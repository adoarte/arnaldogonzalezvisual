# arnaldogonzalezvisual
Arnaldo Drés González (1986) is a venezuelan visual artist based in Hamburg, Germany, whose practice explores the relationship between human introspection and visual poetic experiences through drawings, pictorial interventions, video and photography. His work recreates the ambiguity of human connections, social values, tensions and conflicts of everyday life, inspired by the metaphors of existence, fear, refuge, identity, transit and territory. His ongoing research focuses on turning functional and aesthetic appearances of found materials into symbolic narratives and using the body itself, to transform it into new materialities through digital practices. Arnaldo Drés González is graduated from the fine arts department of UNEARTE in Caracas (2011) and holds a master's degree from the Hochschule für Künste im Sozialen (HKS) in Ottersberg, Germany (2016). In 2015 he won the honorable mention award at the 17th altonale Art Festival in Hamburg. 2019 was selected as a guest artist for the program "Stadtlabor" at the Performing Arts Festival Berlin. In 2021 he was nominated for the art prize of the Atelierkate Lesun in Bremen and invited to the solo exhibition for emerging artists at the Affordable Art Fair Hamburg. His work has been exhibited in national and international art festivals, galleries and fairs since 2008.
