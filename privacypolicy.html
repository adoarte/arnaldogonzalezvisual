<h2 id="m2427">Relevant legal bases</h2><p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>The following is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of them in the data protection declaration.</p>
  <ul><li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose or several specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the person responsible or a third party, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected person who require the protection of personal data prevail.</li></ul><p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the law on the protection against misuse of personal data in data processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
<p><strong>Note on the validity of the GDPR and Swiss DSG: </strong>These data protection notices serve to provide information in accordance with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (Swiss DSG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data", "overriding interest" and "particularly sensitive personal data" used in the Swiss Data Protection Act, the terms "processing" of "personal data" as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss DSG within the scope of the validity of the Swiss DSG.</p>
<h2 id="mOverview">Overview of processing</h2><p>The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing and refers to the data subjects.</p><h3>Types of data processed</h3>
<ul><li>Contact data.</li><li>Content data.</li><li>Usage data.</li><li>Meta, communication and procedural data.</li></ul><h3>Categories of data subjects</h3><ul><li>Users.</li></ul><h3>Purposes of processing</h3><ul><li>Contact requests and communication.</li><li>Feedback.</li><li>Marketing.</li><li>Provision of our online offer and user-friendliness.</li></ul><h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2><p>We take the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, securing availability and their separation. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and reactions to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account when developing or selecting hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>
<h2 id="m25">Transmission of personal data</h2><p>As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or that it is disclosed to them. The recipients of this data can include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>
<h2 id="m24"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Transferencias internacionales de datos</font></font></h2><p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing is carried out within the framework of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transmission of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this is only carried out in accordance with the legal requirements.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transmission (see Art. 49 GDPR), we only process or leave data in third countries with a recognized level of data protection (Art. 45 GDPR), if contractual obligations exist and are fulfilled through the so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or if there are binding internal data protection certifications or standards (see Art. 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/ law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/ law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en</a>) .</span><br></p>
<h2 id="m134">Use of cookies</h2><p>Cookies are small text files or other memory notes that store information on end devices and read information from the end devices. For example, to save the login status in a user account, the content of a shopping cart in an e-shop, the content accessed or the functions used in an online offer. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, e.g. for the purpose of functionality, security and comfort of online offers as well as the creation of analyzes of visitor flows. </p>
<p><strong>Notes on consent: </strong>We use cookies in accordance with legal regulations. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, except where not required by law. In particular, consent is not necessary if the storage and reading of the information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary in order to provide the users with a telemedia service (i.e. our online offer) that they have expressly requested. Strictly necessary cookies usually include cookies with functions that serve to display and run the online offering, load balancing, security, saving user preferences and choices, or similar purposes related to providing the main and ancillary functions of the online offering requested by users. The revocable consent is clearly communicated to the users and contains information on the respective use of cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on the legal basis under data protection law: </strong>The legal basis under data protection law on which we process the personal data of users with the help of cookies depends on whether we ask users for their consent. If the users consent, the legal basis for the processing of your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in the commercial operation of our online offer and improving its usability) or, if this is done in the context of fulfilling our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. We will explain the purposes for which we process cookies in the course of this data protection declaration or as part of our consent and processing processes.</p>
<p><strong>Storage period:&nbsp;</strong>With regard to the storage period, a distinction is made between the following types of cookies:</p><ul><li><strong>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):</strong>&nbsp;Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed his end device (e.g. browser or mobile application).</li><li><strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies also remain saved when the end device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, the user data collected with the help of cookies can be used to measure reach. If we do not provide users with explicit information on the type and storage period of cookies (e.g. when obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage period can be up to two years.</li></ul><p><strong>General information on revocation and objection (so-called "opt-out"): </strong>Users can revoke the consent they have given at any time and object to the processing in accordance with the legal requirements. For this purpose, users can, among other things, restrict the use of cookies in their browser settings (which can also limit the functionality of our online offer). You can also object to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes via the websites <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_new">https://optout.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_new">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>.</p>
<ul class="m-elements"><li class=""><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) GDPR).</li></ul><p><strong>Further information on processing procedures, procedures and services:</strong></p><ul class="m-elements"><li><strong>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent: </strong>We use a procedure for cookie consent management, in the context of which the users consent to the use of cookies or the processing mentioned in the context of the cookie consent management procedure s and providers can be obtained and managed and revoked by the users. The declaration of consent is stored here so that the query does not have to be repeated and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable technologies) in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or his device. Subject to individual information about the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of the consent can be up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created and stored with the time of the consent, information on the scope of the consent (e.g. which categories of cookies and/or service providers) and the browser, system and end device used; <span class=""><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) DSGVO)</span>.</li></ul><h2 id="m136">Presence in social networks (social media)</h2><p>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside of the European Union. This can result in risks for users, for example because it could make it more difficult to enforce user rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the data of the NuUsually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created based on usage behavior and the resulting interests of users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements inside and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behavior and the interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the usage profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the possibility of objection (opt-out), we refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.</p>
<p>Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would like to point out that these can most effectively be asserted with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.</p>

<p>The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content or functions. We endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website.
